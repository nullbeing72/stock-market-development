## 1. Overview

Ticker-Teller is a research-grade, full-stack financial analysis application that combines classical
quantitative finance features with modern deep-learning architectures.

**What it does end-to-end:**

1. Fetches live OHLCV and macro data from Yahoo Finance for any ticker
2. Engineers **31 features** spanning price action, momentum indicators, bonds, and commodities
3. Runs **IDEC autoencoder deep clustering** across all 31 features to produce a data-driven, year-wise market risk assessment — replacing the older Fuzzy C-Means approach
4. Trains a hybrid **CNN → BiLSTM → Multi-Head Attention** model in real time, streaming every epoch to the browser via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. Produces a **Monte Carlo price forecast** with ±1σ confidence bands using MC-Dropout (80 passes)
6. Displays everything in a dark-mode React dashboard with interactive charts, macro panels, and a live training monitor

**Supported tickers:** Any Yahoo Finance symbol — US equities (`AAPL`), Indian stocks (`RELIANCE.NS`), crypto (`BTC-USD`), ETFs (`SPY`), indices (`^NSEI`), and more.

**Concurrency model:** Two `ThreadPoolExecutor` pools — a 2-worker pool for CPU/GPU training
(prevents resource contention), and an 8-worker pool for concurrent data-fetch endpoints.
A `threading.Event` cancellation token propagates client-disconnect signals into the training loop,
stopping work the moment the browser tab is closed.

**In-memory cache:** All slow data fetches are cached per `"type:ticker:period"` key with a 1-hour TTL
(`_TTL = 3600s`), avoiding redundant Yahoo Finance calls within a session.

---

## 4. Feature Engineering — 31 Input Features

All 31 features are computed in `src/data.py` and then normalised to `[0, 1]` via `MinMaxScaler`
before entering the model. `ffill → bfill → fillna(0)` is applied to handle market closure gaps.

## 5. Prediction Model — CNN → BiLSTM → Attention

The `HybridModel` in `src/model.py` takes a rolling window of `seq_length` days × 31 features
and predicts the next day's log-return (a scalar).

### Key Design Choices

| Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Log-return targets** | Stationary signal; avoids price-scale sensitivity across tickers |
| **Dual CNN kernels (3 + 5)** | Captures short and medium-range local patterns simultaneously |
| **Bidirectional LSTM** | Encodes both forward and backward temporal context |
| **Soft temporal pooling** | Learns *which* time steps in the window matter most |
| **Inception-style residual** | Avoids vanishing gradients in the CNN block |
| **MC-Dropout** | BatchNorm frozen, only Dropout stochastic — correct inference behaviour |

---

## 6. Loss Function

$L_{total} = L_{huber}(δ=0.01) + 0.4 × L_{directional}$

### Huber Loss
Robust to outlier log-returns from earnings surprises or flash crashes.
With δ=0.01 it operates in the linear regime for most typical daily moves
$(|return| > 0.01 → linear; |return| ≤ 0.01 → quadratic).$

### Directional Penalty
$L_{directional} = mean( relu( -sign(pred) * sign(target) ) )$

Fires a constant penalty of **1.0** whenever the model predicts the wrong
direction (up vs down), regardless of magnitude. The sign-based formulation
ensures the penalty is always meaningful — a naive `pred × target` product
produces near-zero values for small log-returns, making the weight useless
on low-volatility assets.

---

## 7. Training Pipeline

```
 1.  Fetch OHLCV history + macro data (bonds, commodities, market index)
 2.  Engineer all 31 features (data.py)
 3.  Run IDEC autoencoder deep clustering → adc_risk dict
 4.  Scale all features to [0,1] with MinMaxScaler
 5.  Build overlapping sequences of length seq_length
 6.  Time-ordered split: 70% train / 15% val / 15% test  (no shuffling)
 7.  DataLoaders (batch_size=32, pin_memory if CUDA available)
 8.  Train with AdamW + CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts scheduler
     ├── Gradient clipping: max_norm = 1.0
     ├── Early stopping (patience=10; best-val-loss weights restored)
     └── Every epoch → SSE event pushed to browser (loss, LR, step)
 9.  Evaluate on held-out test set
     └── Convert predicted log-returns → prices → MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Dir.Acc.
10.  Monte Carlo forecast for next N days (80 stochastic passes per step)
11.  Package full result → SSE "result" event → frontend renders
```

**No data leakage:** The `MinMaxScaler` is fitted only on the training split and
applied to val and test — refit at inference time is avoided.

---

## 8. Monte Carlo Uncertainty Estimation

The model is put into `eval()` mode to freeze BatchNorm running statistics,
then all `nn.Dropout` layers are explicitly switched back to `train()` mode:

```python
model.eval()
for m in model.modules():
    if isinstance(m, nn.Dropout):
        m.train()
```

**Why not just call `model.train()`?** That would re-enable BatchNorm's
batch-statistics mode. At inference time the rolling forecast window has
batch size = 1, making batch statistics meaningless and corrupting the
layer's output. The above approach is the correct MC-Dropout technique.

**80 stochastic forward passes** are run per forecast step. The mean
log-return predicts the next price; the standard deviation gives the ±1σ
confidence band. The forecast rolls forward autoregressively — each predicted
close becomes part of the next input window.

---

## 9. Autoencoder Deep Clustering — IDEC Risk Analysis

This is the core algorithmic upgrade in v1.1. The section explains the
theoretical foundations and the exact implementation in `src/data.py`.

---

### 9.1 Why Autoencoders for Risk Clustering?

The previous Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) approach had three structural weaknesses:

1. **Manual feature selection** — only 3 of 31 features were used (volatility,
   beta, drawdown). Macro signals (bond yields, commodities, Buffett proxy)
   were entirely ignored in the risk model.

2. **Fixed membership function** — FCM's fuzzifier parameter `m=2` defines
   the shape of cluster boundaries rigidly. The data never gets to influence
   what "high risk" looks like.

3. **Curse of dimensionality** — clustering in raw high-dimensional space
   produces unreliable results as distances become increasingly uniform.
   An autoencoder first compresses the data into a meaningful low-dimensional
   latent space before clustering occurs.

An **autoencoder** addresses all three:

- It reads **all 31 features** simultaneously
- It learns which combinations of features actually separate market regimes
- It creates a **latent space** where similar market conditions are nearby
  and different ones are far apart — making clustering far more reliable

---

### 9.2 What Is an Autoencoder?

An autoencoder is a neural network trained to compress input data into a
low-dimensional representation (the **latent space** or **embedding**) and
then reconstruct the original input from that representation.

```
Input x  ──>  Encoder f  ──>  Latent z  ──>  Decoder g  ──>  Reconstruction x̂
              (compress)                      (expand)
```

$Loss = ||x - x̂||²$   (MSE — how well does x̂ match x?)


The encoder is forced to learn which features matter most, because the latent
space `z` has far fewer dimensions than `x`. Irrelevant features are naturally
discarded. Related features are fused.

In our implementation:

```
Encoder: d → 256 → 128 → 64 → latent_dim   (BatchNorm + GELU activations)
Decoder: latent_dim → 64 → 128 → 256 → d   (mirrored, symmetric)
```

Where `d = 31` (number of features) and `latent_dim ∈ [4, 10]` (chosen
adaptively as `min(10, max(4, d // 4))`).

---

### 9.3 From AE to Deep Clustering — the DEC / IDEC Framework

Training just the autoencoder gives a good latent representation, but does
not optimise it for clustering. **DEC (Deep Embedded Clustering, Xie et al.
2016)** and its improvement **IDEC (Improved DEC, Guo et al. 2017)** add a
clustering objective on top of the reconstruction objective.

The key idea: define a probability distribution over cluster assignments
in the latent space, then train the network to make high-confidence
assignments even more confident (self-reinforcing).

---

### 9.4 The Student-t Soft Assignment (Q Distribution)

For each data point $z_i$ in the latent space and each cluster centre $μ_j$,
the **soft assignment** $q_{i,j}$ measures how likely point $i$ belongs to
cluster $j$. It uses a **Student-t distribution kernel** (same as t-SNE):

$q_{i,j} = \frac{(1 + ||z_i - μ_j||² / α)^{-(α+1)/2}}{Σ_j' (1 + ||z_i - μ_j'||² / α)^{-(α+1)/2}}$

- `α = 1` (degrees of freedom — standard choice)
- The result is normalised so all $q_{i,j}$ sum to 1 for each point `i`
- Heavy tails of the Student-t distribution allow points far from all centres
  to still receive meaningful (not near-zero) assignments

This is **soft clustering** — every trading day gets a continuous
membership score in [0, 1] for *each* of the 4 clusters simultaneously.

---

### 9.5 The Target Distribution (P Distribution)

IDEC introduces a **target distribution** `P` that sharpens the soft
assignments — it takes the current `Q` and amplifies high-confidence
assignments while suppressing uncertain ones:
         
$p_{i,j} = \frac{q²_{i,j} / f_j}{Σ_j' (q²_{i,j'} / f_j')}$

Where $f_j = Σ_i q_{i,j}$ is the soft cluster size (prevents large
clusters from dominating the loss).

**Intuition:** If a point is already 80% assigned to cluster 2, `P` makes
it look like 95%. If a point is uncertain (25% across 4 clusters), `P`
keeps it uncertain. This iteratively pulls points toward their dominant
cluster, creating cleaner separation.

---

### 9.6 The Joint IDEC Loss

IDEC optimises both objectives simultaneously:

$L_{total} = λ · L_{rec}  +  (1 - λ) · KL(P ‖ Q)$


Where:
- $L_{rec} = MSE(x̂, x)$ — reconstruction loss, keeps the embedding
  meaningful and prevents cluster collapse
- $KL(P ‖ Q) = Σ_i Σ_j p_{i,j} · log(p_{i,j} / q_{i,j})$ — KL
  divergence from target P to soft assignment Q, pushes the model
  to match high-confidence assignments
- `λ = 0.1` — reconstruction has a smaller weight; clustering drives
  most of the gradient

This is a **simultaneous** optimisation strategy (per the survey taxonomy):
both the autoencoder weights and the cluster centres $μ_j$ are updated
together in every gradient step.

---

### 9.8 High-Risk Cluster Identification

After training, we need to label which of the 4 clusters represents
"high risk". We do this with **volatility-based identification** —
no human labelling required:

```python
# 21-day annualised volatility for every trading day
vol_21 = log_returns.rolling(21).std() * sqrt(252)

# Mean volatility of all days assigned to each cluster
cluster_mean_vol[k] = mean(vol_21[labels == k])

# The cluster with highest mean volatility is high risk
high_risk_cluster = argmax(cluster_mean_vol)
```

This is automatic and data-driven: if the market regime shifts over
time and volatility patterns change, the clustering adapts at the
next run.

---

### 9.9 The Risk Score

Each trading day's **risk score** is its soft membership `q_{i, high_risk}`
— a continuous value in `[0, 1]`.

- Score **≥ 0.65** → 🔴 **High Risk**
- Score **≥ 0.40** → 🟡 **Moderate Risk**
- Score **< 0.40** → 🟢 **Low Risk**

Year-wise risk evolution:
```
yearly[year] = mean(q_{i, high_risk}  for all trading days i in year)
current_score = q_{last_day, high_risk}
```

The ADC panel in the frontend shows:
- Current score + risk label (colour-coded)
- Overall mean across all years
- 4-cluster annualised volatility pills (sorted low → high)
- Year-wise bar chart (each bar coloured by its risk level)
- Year-wise table with exact scores
- Full methodology explanation inline

### 9.10 ADC vs FCM — Side-by-Side Comparison

| Property | FCM (v1.0) | IDEC / ADC (v1.1) |
|---|---|---|
| Features used | 3 (volatility, beta, drawdown) | All 31 |
| Cluster count | 2 | 4 |
| Latent space | None (raw feature space) | Learned by autoencoder |
| Cluster shape | Spherical (Euclidean distance) | Arbitrary (learned geometry) |
| Assignment type | Soft (fuzzy membership) | Soft (Student-t probability) |
| Optimisation | Alternating U and C updates | Joint AE + clustering gradient |
| High-risk labelling | Higher volatility centroid | Highest mean 21d ann. vol. cluster |
| Adapts to data | Limited (fixed fuzzifier) | Yes (learned encoder transforms) |
| Dependencies | Pure NumPy | PyTorch + scikit-learn (KMeans init) |
| Theoretical basis | Bezdek 1981 | DEC (Xie 2016) + IDEC (Guo 2017) |

---

### 9.11 Why IDEC Specifically, Not Plain DEC?

Original DEC (Xie et al. 2016) sets `λ = 0` — it discards the reconstruction
loss entirely after pre-training, using only the KL divergence. This causes
**embedding distortion**: the latent space can collapse (all points pulled to
their cluster centres), destroying the meaningful geometry the autoencoder
learned.

IDEC (Guo et al. 2017) keeps `λ > 0` throughout clustering — the
reconstruction loss acts as a **regulariser**, preventing collapse and
preserving local structure. In practice this consistently outperforms DEC
on accuracy metrics while keeping the embedding interpretable.

In our implementation: `λ = 0.1` (clustering dominates but reconstruction
is never fully ignored).

---

## 10. Macro-Economic Panels

### Commodities Panel

Fetches 5 commodity futures via yfinance (GC=F, SI=F, HG=F, ALI=F, BZ=F)
and applies **Holt's Linear (Double) Exponential Smoothing** (α=0.3, β=0.1)
to produce a multi-day forecast with ±1σ confidence bands.

The trend is initialised using the global slope `(s[-1] - s[0]) / (n-1)`
rather than a naive single-step initialisation, which produces stable
and smooth trend estimates even on noisy commodity series.

Each commodity card includes a 🏭 **Industries** button that shows
sector-sensitivity impact analysis for the 5 most relevant industries
(e.g. Airlines for Brent Oil, Solar/EV for Silver). Impact prices are
clearly labelled as **illustrative simulations** — not live quotes.

### Bond Yields Panel

- **US 5Y / 10Y**: fetched directly (^FVX, ^TNX)
- **India, Germany, UK, Japan**: ETF-anchored synthetic yields derived from
  ETF log-return drift normalised and anchored to fixed reference rates
  (e.g. India 6.80%, Germany 2.45%) with US 10Y sensitivity factor
- **Yield curve inversion alert**: fires when US 10Y < US 5Y

### GDP Proxy Panel

Annualised 252-day ETF returns (SPY, INDA, FXI, EZU, EWJ, EWU, EWZ) used
as directional economic momentum proxies. IMF consensus estimates shown
alongside. Holt smoothing for 30-day directional forecast.

> ⚠ ETF returns ≠ GDP. SPY +36% does not mean US GDP grew 36%.
> ETF values are directional proxies only.

### Correlations Panel

Pearson correlation between each of the 31 features and the Close price,
computed on the full engineered dataframe post-analysis.

## 11. Frontend — React Dashboard

Built with React 18 + Vite 5 + Recharts 2. Single-page application with
tab-based navigation and hamburger menu for macro panels.

### Tabs

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Price & Forecast** | Historical OHLCV chart (BB bands, RSI, volume), test-set predictions, MC forecast with ±1σ bands, range buttons (1M/3M/6M/1Y/2Y/ALL) |
| **Model Performance** | ADC Risk panel, metric cards (MAE/RMSE/MAPE/Dir.Acc.), training loss curves, data split indicators |
| **More Analysis** (☰) | Bond yields, commodity forecasts, GDP proxies, feature correlations |

### Live Training via SSE

The `POST /api/analyze` endpoint returns a `text/event-stream` response.
`api.js` consumes it with the browser's `EventSource`-compatible fetch:

```
SSE event: "status"  → status bar update
SSE event: "epoch"   → training progress panel, loss sparkline
SSE event: "result"  → full payload, all charts rendered
SSE event: "error"   → error display with traceback
```

### ADC Risk Panel (`AdcRiskPanel.jsx`)

Displays:
- **Current risk score** — last trading day's high-risk soft membership
- **Overall mean** — mean score across all years
- **4-cluster volatility pills** — annualised vol % at each cluster centre,
  sorted low→high, colour-coded (green → blue → amber → red)
- **Year-wise bar chart** — each bar coloured by its risk level (green/amber/red)
- **Year table** — exact scores + risk label per year
- **Methodology card** — inline explanation of the IDEC phases

## 14. Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) CUDA-capable GPU with PyTorch CUDA build

### Quickstart (Linux / macOS / GitHub Codespaces)

```bash
# 1. Clone / unzip and enter the project
cd stockmarket_dl_adc

# 2. Create Python virtual environment and install dependencies
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# 3. Run everything with the launcher script
chmod +x stock.sh
./stock.sh
```

The script will:
- Start the FastAPI backend on port 8000
- Run `npm install` if `node_modules` is missing
- Start the Vite dev server on port 5173
- Print both URLs when ready

### GitHub Codespaces

After `./stock.sh` shows `✔ All systems up!`:

1. Open the **Ports** tab in the VS Code bottom panel
2. Port **5173** should be listed and auto-forwarded (Vite now prints to stdout)
3. If it's not listed: click **Add Port → 5173**, right-click → **Port Visibility → Public**
4. Click the 🌐 globe icon next to 5173

> The app is on **port 5173** (React). Port 8000 is the raw API — it shows
> `{"detail":"Not Found"}` on the root path, which is normal.

### Manual Start (without stock.sh)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

### GPU Support

```bash
# CUDA 12.x
pip install torch>=2.3.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

The backend auto-detects CUDA via `torch.cuda.is_available()` and reports
the device in `/api/health` and the `result` payload.

## 17. Disclaimer

> ⚠ **This application is for educational and research purposes only.**
> Nothing in Ticker-Teller constitutes financial advice. All forecasts
> carry significant model risk and uncertainty. Do not use as the sole
> basis for any financial or investment decision.

**Technical limitations to be aware of:**

- **Yahoo Finance data quality**: gaps, split/dividend adjustments, and
  occasional erroneous ticks are possible. `ffill/bfill/fillna(0)` are
  applied as fallbacks but cannot guarantee clean data for all tickers.
- **GDP panel**: ETF returns are directional proxies — not official GDP
  statistics. IMF consensus estimates are shown alongside for comparison.
- **Bond yield proxies**: Non-US yields (India, Germany, UK, Japan) are
  synthetic, anchored to fixed reference rates. They are indicative only.
- **Industry impact modal**: All impact prices are illustrative simulations
  seeded by date — not live market quotes.
- **MC-Dropout calibration**: Bands reflect parameter uncertainty (epistemic)
  only, not data uncertainty (aleatoric).
- **No model persistence**: Each run re-trains from scratch. Add
  checkpointing for production use.
- **In-memory cache**: Lost on restart. Use Redis for multi-worker deployments.
- **IDEC runtime**: The three-phase IDEC training adds ~5–15 seconds to the
  analysis pipeline depending on dataset size and CPU speed. On GPU the
  overhead is negligible.
